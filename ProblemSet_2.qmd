## Problem 1 - Dice Game

This problem asks to create a function that codes for a dice game that abides by the following rules:
- The game uses a 6-sided dice and costs $2 to play
- Winning roll requires a 3 or 5; anything else you lose
- 

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this 

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
